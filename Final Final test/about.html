            Ben Mongomery is a silver 2 CSGO semi-pro player. His accolades include bottom fragging in 73% of games. <br>
            His main role is entry fragger, losing 67% of opening duels on T side Inferno. He knows very few smokes <br>
            and averages around seven kills a game. Along with his great looking team mates, especially the top frag <br>
            Inept or Scott, they proceed to lose almost every game that they play on Faceit. Ben has contributed greatly<br>
            to the fall in player counts being voted the #1 worst player in MM and continues his streak of a record 45 <br>
            games at bottom of the server, Keep it up Ben!

                Look at this man, his name is Scott. <br>
                He sometimes can be good at csgo but also likes to throw really hard. <br>
                If you say whatever dude near him, he will mock you for a few minutes.

        <h1>Description of project</h1>
        <p>
            We used Vue framework for easier Js functionality for example we used v-for loops to retrieve data <br> 
            We used the leaflet Api to create a map that has many functions like panning and zooming <br> 
            We used nominatum Api to convert address' to coordinates to search locations inside the set boundaries <br>
            We used the same map style attribution as the nominatum Api for the most detailed map <br>

                Macalester-Groveland had 231 meaning more crime happens near the Macalester Campus so UST
