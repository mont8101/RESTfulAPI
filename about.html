    <p>
        Ben Mongomery is a silver 2 CSGO semi-pro player.  His accolades include bottom fragging in 73% of games.
        His main role is entry fragger, losing 67% of opening duels on CT side Inferno. He knows very few smokes
        and averages around seven kills a game.  Along with his great looking team mates, especially the top frag 
        Inept or Scott, they proceed to lose almost every game that they play on Faceit.  Ben has contributed
        greatly to the fall in player counts being voted the #1 worst player in MM and continues his streak of a 
        record 45 games at bottom of the server, Keep it up Ben!
